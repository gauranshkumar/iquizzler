# iquizzler

An app to test your IQ.

## IQuizzler - Web

I have released the app to web so if you want to try *now* then head over to [IQuizzler-Web](https://gauranshkumar.github.io/iquizzler-web/)

> Also if you want to test it on real **Android** device then download the release from [IQuizzler-Android-Release](https://github.com/gauranshkumar/iquizzler/releases
).

# Build From Source:
Build Instructions from Source Code.
> But before that please make sure you have **installed and setup the Flutter** if not then go to Installed and Setup Flutter if not the goto [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Steps to build:
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/gauranshkumar/iquizzler.git`.
2. Open the github project in either **Android Studio** or **VSCode**.
3. Open the terminal and type `flutter pub get` to download all the dependencies.
4. Now type `flutter run -d <deviceName>` instead of `<deviceName>` put the name of your device attached to run the app.
5. If you want to build the app then type `flutter build <type>` and instead of `<type>` put the type of build eg. `apk` or `web`.
    > To build for Web you must enable Web support to know more go to [Flutter for Web](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web).
